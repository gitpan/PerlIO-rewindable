NAME

PerlIO::rewindable - I/O layer to allow rewinding of streams

DESCRIPTION

This PerlIO layer makes it possible to rewind an input stream that would
otherwise not be rewindable, such as a TTY or a pipe from another process.
Reads pass through this layer, reading from the underlying stream, but
this layer keeps a copy of everything that is read.  seek can be used
to move around within the saved data to reread it.

seeks may be relative (whence=1, SEEK_CUR) or absolute (whence=1,
SEEK_SET).  For the purposes of absolute seeking, position 0 is wherever
the stream was when this layer was pushed.  tell can be used to read
this absolute position.  End-relative seeks (whence=2, SEEK_END) are
not supported, even if the underlying stream has signalled EOF.  If the
underlying stream is actually seekable, for example if it is actually
a regular file, that aspect of it is hidden by the rewindability layer.

Seeking both backwards and forwards is supported within the saved data
that was previously read.  Seeking forwards past the last data read from
the underlying stream is not currently supported, but this may change
in the future.

Writing is not permitted through the rewindability layer.

If this layer is popped, it attempts to maintain any rewound state, by
generating a temporary PerlIO layer to hold pending data.  This is then
subject to normal PerlIO behaviour, which does not strongly maintain
consistency of such rewinding.
